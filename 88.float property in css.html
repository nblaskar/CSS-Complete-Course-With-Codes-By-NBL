Today in the world of Information technology with growth of technical advancement of human civilization. We have reached a stage where information is now regarded as one of the most valuable assets. The need of proper information at the right place at the right time is less said than felt. Improved technology raised the standard of living all around the world, have provided us with novel inventions which have made out living easier. But along with this it has brought an avalanche of information which needs to be used by humans at every walk of life. Many today is billable files in the old manual way would amount to a tiny fraction of total required. The advancement in information technology had showed us a way to get out of this gigantic problem. Today heaps and heaps of information can be stored in a very efficient way by computerizing the process. The purpose of Railway Reservation System is to automate the existing manual system by the help of computerized equipment’s and full-Fledged computer software, fulfilling their requirements, so that their valuable data/information can be stored for a longer period with easy accessing and manipulation of the same. The required software and hardware are easily available and easy to work with. The aim is to automate its existing manual system by the help of computerized equipment’s and full-fledged computer software, fulfilling their requirements, so that their valuable/information can be stored for longer period with easy accessing and manipulation of the same.

PROBLEM STATEMENT
Currently, the type of system being used at the counter is an internal system which is manually used in selling the train tickets. The problems facing the company are that customers have to go to the counter to buy train ticket or ask for train schedule, customers will also have to queue up for a long time in order to secure a train ticket and will also need to pay cash when they buy the bus ticket. Also the present working train management software’s are slow and robust and complicated for many users.
The railway reservation system is expected to carry out tasks as a manual railway management system. The system is expected to store trains of different routes along with price and other details. The user can easily select the route he/she wants and get the list of the train and price. Only the admin is entrusted the rights to add train details and view no of trains booked as well as the no of users in the system profiles that book tickets. After the ticket is booked it can be printed and saved as a proof verification.
